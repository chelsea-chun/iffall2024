        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p>1. Hello, I'm Chelsea Chun, a junior majoring in Psychology and Communication Design!</p>
        <p>2. I'm interested in both psychology and art. The idea of design and creative processes applying to any form of code-adjacent form is completely new territory for me, so I thought this would be a useful class to take for my major! </p>
        <p>3. I don't have any real experience with HTML/CSS/JS aside from things like scratch.io in middle/highschool for AP CSP or casual tinkering on forum thread games that operate with css to decorate posts.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to learn the foundations of the interactions between design and html/css so that I have a better understanding of the possibilities within this creative outlet.</p>
        <p>5. I expect designing for the screen requires understanding a new "language" to communicate with the computer to produce the response/results I want, and thus will be much more experimental than the familiarity of straightforward, physical paper.</p>
        <p>6. I think my local tea shop <a href="https://www.omomoteashoppe.com">OMOMO</a> has nice web design. It's clear and simple -- both trademarks of its brand, reflective of its physical store concept/interior design and the nature of their drinks.</p>
        <p>7. <a href="https://www.kakaocorp.com/page/">Kakao</a> is a widely used messaging platform in South Korea, and unsurprisingly their website interface reflects their strengths in communication. Each subject is easy to recognize and identify, all while providing a harmonious theme matching its brand identity.</p>
        <p>8. Overall, <a href="https://parisbaguette.com">Paris Baguette</a>'s website is also effective and serves the bakery/cafe well, providing both information and visual branding to establish its identity to potential browsers/customers. </p>
