                        Anna May Wong (1905â€“1961) was the first Chinese-American actress to gain international recognition. She began her career in silent films, making her debut in The Toll of the Sea (1922) and quickly rising to prominence with roles in The Thief of Bagdad (1924). As sound films took over, Wong faced typecasting in Hollywood, often portraying exotic or stereotypical characters like the "dragon lady" in Shanghai Express (1932).
                        <br>
                        Frustrated by limited roles, Wong moved to Europe in the 1930s, where she found more diverse opportunities, starring in films like Piccadilly (1929). She continued to build her career internationally, earning acclaim for her performances.
                        <br>
                        In the 1950s, Wong made history as the first Asian-American woman to lead a U.S. TV series, The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong (1951), though it lasted only one season. Despite Hollywood's racial barriers, she persisted in challenging the industry's narrow view of Asian roles, establishing herself as a trailblazer in both film and television.
