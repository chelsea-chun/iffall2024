            I saw you walking down the street one day
            It was a Sunday
            You had flowers in your hair
            And you were dancing with your headphones on
            Didn't care that everyone was watching
            You were moving to the beat
            Cars were swerving in the street
            Just to get a glimpse of you
            And you were posing for them
            Yeah, you were struttin' for them
            'Cause you know just what you do
            So if I never told you baby
            You should know I'm going crazy
            I can't help myself anymore
            'Cause I've been looking for the one
            And now I think I found you love
            'Cause things have never been this good before
            'Cause you're dancing in the corner
            You're dancing how you wanna
            And I can't help but smile
            And then I start to tap my feet
            And babe we're moving to the beat, yeah
            Summer nights with you and I
            I never thought I would've felt that love
            I was dreaming of
            But my head is over heels and now you got me
            And I just can't breathe with you here babe
            You should know
            You can tell me how you feel
            Pour your heart out if it's real
            We can dance 'til three in the morning
            And I don't wanna pretend like I just wanna be friends
            So if I'm being honest, oh
            So if I never told you baby
            You should know I'm going crazy
            I can't help myself anymore
            'Cause I've been looking for the one
            And now I think I found you love
            'Cause things have never been this good before
            'Cause you're dancing in the corner

            And I can't help but smile
            And then I start to tap my feet
            And babe we're moving to the beat, yeah
            Summer nights with you and I
            Honestly it's such a shame
            When my friends are getting in the way
            But I just don't know what to say
            'Cause it's hard for me to walk away
            Honestly it's such a shame
            When my friends are getting in the way
            But I just don't know what to say
            It's hard for me to walk away
            So if I never told you baby
            You should know I'm going crazy
