            <h2>Mango Bingsu</h2>
                <p>The best way to cool down a hot day is with a nice cold treat. Bingsu, Korean shaved ice, is the perfect dessert to do just that! Icy, yet still creamy, and with an infinite choice of toppings whatâ€™s not to love about it.</p>

                <p class="underline"><i>Ingredients:</i></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>4.5 Cups Milk</li>
                        <li>1.2 cup Condensed Milk</li>
                        <li>Diced Mangoes</li>
                    </ol>

                <p class="underline"><i>Instructions:</i></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a freezer-safe container, mix the milk and condensed milk together using a whisk.</li>
                        <li>Cover the mixture and freeze for at least 5 hours or overnight.</li>
                        <li>While the mixture is freezing, prepare your toppings. You can chop up some fruits like mangoes, strawberries, kiwi or bananas. Set them aside.</li>
                        <li>After the mixture has frozen, remove it from the container and wrap it in some plastic wrap. This will make it easier to hold.</li>
                        <li>Hold the wrapped up milk block with a towel to protect your skin and begin shaving it into a bowl using a grater. You can also use a food processor with a grater attachment.</li>
                        <li>Add your favourite toppings and drizzle some condensed milk on top. Enjoy!</li>

                        This recipe is by a Korean for the Korean audience, who don't see bingsu as much as a novelty as the Western audience may. Therefore, it's a lot more tailored for the average household, making this recipe in particular easy to make, accomodating for people who lack the larger, fancier kitchen tools to make shaved ice desserts without compromising on taste and enjoyment.</li>
