            <h2>Mango Bingsu</h2>

                <p>The best way to cool down a hot day is with a nice cold treat. Bingsu, Korean shaved ice, is the perfect dessert to do just that! Icy, yet still creamy, and with an infinite choice of toppings what's not to love about it.</p>

                <p class="underline"><i>Instructions:</i></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a freezer-safe container or strong zipper lock bag, mix the milk and condensed milk together using a whisk or any mixing/blending instrument.</li>
                        <li>Close the container with the mixture and freeze for at least 5 hours or overnight until solid.</li>
                        <li>While the mixture is freezing, prepare your toppings. You can chop up some fruits like mangoes, strawberries, kiwi or grapes. Set them aside for later.</li>
                        <li>After the mixture has frozen, remove it from the container if frozen in a solid shape tray or hard container. This will make it easier to hold. If frozen in a ziplock bag, take it out as is.</li>
                        <li>Hold the wrapped up milk block with a towel to protect your skin and begin shaving it into a bowl using a grater. You can also use a food processor with a grater attachment or a blender. If in a ziplock bag, wrap it with a towel and gently hammer it with a large and hard utensil until broken into milk slush.</li>
                        <li>Transfer the shaved milk into a bowl, add your favourite toppings and drizzle some condensed milk on top. Enjoy!</li>
                    </ol>

                        <br>
                        This recipe isn't mango bingsu specifically, but Maangchi is well-known for her easy-entry Korean cuisine recipes for the Western audience. Her credibility and reknown themselves make this recipe worth referencing for a better general knowledge on making bingsu.</li>

                        <br>
                        This recipe is by a Korean for the Korean audience, who don't see bingsu as much as a novelty as the Western audience may. Therefore, it's a lot more tailored for the average household, making this recipe in particular easy to make, accomodating for people who lack the larger, fancier kitchen tools to make shaved ice desserts without compromising on taste and enjoyment.</li>

                        The hierarchy treatment and sectioning in the web design for copic markers is a useful reference that I can refer to. It could be used as inspiration for ways to play with different treatments of text.</li>
